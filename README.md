# Important !
I do not claim any of the formulas, I just tried to understand them and applied them

# Description
This is a tentative of a simulation of water (with 1000 particles) in a cube-form glass, using smoothed-particle hydrodynamics method

# What's next
The demonstration is very poor so:
 - Create better simulation 
 - Be able to move the container
 - Use of shaders
 - Still need some optimization, quite slow for more than 5000 particles
 - Etc.
